## Compatibility

`greensms-php` is compatible with PHP 5.5 and PHP 7+ onwards until the latest PHP Version

## Methods

- You can either use username/password combination or auth token to create an object with constructor
- Each API Function is available as `MODULE.FUNCTION()`
- Parameters for each API can be referred from [here][apidocs]
- Response keys by default are available in `snake_case`. If you want to use `camelCase`, then pass `'camelCaseResponse'= > true`, in the constructor
